# GitHub Actions Best Practices

### 1. GitHub Actions Best Practices Guide

**Security Best Practices**

	•	Pin actions to specific commit SHAs instead of tags to prevent supply chain attacks

	• Use OpenID Connect (OIDC) for authentication instead of long-lived secrets

	•	Implement least privilege permissions by explicitly defining minimal required permissions

	•	Audit third-party actions and prefer verified creators

	•	Secure secrets management practices

	•	Prevent workflow injection attacks by sanitizing user inputs
  
**Workflow Optimization**

	•	Use dependency caching to reduce build times significantly

	•	Implement matrix builds for parallel testing across multiple environments

	•	Use conditional execution to skip unnecessary steps

	•	Set appropriate timeouts to prevent workflows from running indefinitely

	•	Optimize job dependencies using the needs 
  
**CI/CD Pipeline Best Practices**

	•	Create reusable workflows to centralize common processes

	•	Use composite actions for repeated sequences of steps

	•	Implement comprehensive testing strategies including unit, integration, and security tests

	•	Environment-specific deployments with proper approval processes

	•	Use workflow templates for organization-wide consistency[10]

**Performance Optimization**

	•	Choose appropriate runners based on workload requirements

	•	Manage workflow concurrency to prevent resource conflicts

	•	Optimize container usage with specific image tags and minimal sizes

	•	Minimize network requests and use local caching strategies

**Advanced Configurations**

	•	Dynamic matrix generation for adaptive testing

	•	Custom runners configuration for special requirements
  
	•	Advanced triggering and workflow orchestration
